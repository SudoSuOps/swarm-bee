### Post 1 — The Data Problem

Most AI teams spend 60-80% of project time on data preparation.

Not model architecture. Not deployment. Data.

We've verified 790,000+ training pairs across medical, aviation, legal, and finance. Each one passes a 4-stage pipeline with a 235B-parameter verifier.

The result: 30/30 on our SFT suitability benchmark. 93.6% raw-to-platinum conversion rate.

If your team is building production AI and spending months on data cleaning, we should talk.

### Post 2 — Why Synthetic Data Fails

Synthetic training data has a compounding error problem.

Model A generates pairs. Model B trains on them. Model B's errors get baked into production. Nobody catches it until users start churning.

Our approach: generate with a 70B model, then independently verify with a 235B model using Chain-of-Verification. Pairs that fail get rejected or rewritten. Not recycled.

790K+ verified pairs. Zero shortcuts.

### Post 3 — The Vertical Play

Generic training data produces generic models.

We build domain-specific datasets:
- Medical AI: 390K+ pairs, 80 specialties
- Aviation AI: MRO, safety, ATC, pilot training
- Legal: contract analysis, regulatory compliance
- Finance: underwriting, risk, market analysis

Each vertical uses domain-specific verification templates and authoritative source material.

Your model should know your domain better than a general-purpose LLM. That starts with the data.

### Post 4 — Build vs. Buy

Building a verified training dataset in-house:
- 3-6 months of SME time
- Annotation tooling and QA pipeline
- $200K-$500K minimum budget
- Still no guarantee of SFT quality

Or: license verified, deduplicated packs with proof-of-lineage and drop them into your pipeline on day one.

We've already done the hard part. 790K+ pairs verified by a 235B-parameter model. JSONL format. Enterprise licensing.

### Post 5 — Proof of Compute

Every dataset we ship comes with proof-of-compute lineage.

You know exactly:
- Which models generated the pair
- Which verifier scored it
- What score it received
- When it was produced

No black boxes. No mystery provenance. Anchored on-chain.

This is what enterprise data buyers should demand. If your data vendor can't show you the lineage, ask why.

### X Post 1

Most AI teams burn 6 months cleaning data before training starts.

We verified 790K+ training pairs with a 235B-parameter pipeline.

30/30 SFT benchmark. 93.6% conversion rate.

Generic data -> generic model.

We build domain-specific datasets:
- Medical: 390K+ pairs, 80 specialties
- Aviation: MRO, safety, ATC
- Legal, Finance, Research

Verified. Licensed. Ready for SFT.

### X Post 3

Your training data has no lineage?

Ours does. Every pair traced: generation model, verification model, score, timestamp, on-chain anchor.

790K+ pairs. Zero mystery provenance.

### X Post 4

Building a training dataset in-house = $200K-$500K and 6 months.

Licensing verified packs = drop into your pipeline on day one.

We've done the hard part.

### X Post 5

4-stage verification pipeline:
1. 70B generates the pair
2. 235B verifies independently
3. Failed pairs rejected or rewritten
4. Survivors scored and anchored

93.6% conversion rate. The 6.4% don't make it through.

## VSL Video Outline (60-90 seconds)

**Title**: "Verified Training Data for Production AI"

**[0:00-0:10] Hook**
- Visual: Clean text on dark background
- "Most AI teams spend 6 months cleaning data before they train a single model."
- Beat. "There's a better way."

**[0:10-0:25] The Problem**
- Visual: Simple animated stats/diagrams
- "60-80% of ML project time goes to data preparation."
- "Synthetic data compounds errors. Internal datasets cost $200K+. And quality is invisible until production."

**[0:25-0:45] The Solution**
- Visual: Pipeline diagram (generate -> verify -> score -> deliver)
- "We built a multi-model verification pipeline."
- "70B-parameter generation. 235B-parameter independent verification."
- "Chain-of-Verification scores every pair. 93.6% conversion rate."
- "790,000 verified pairs across medical, aviation, legal, and finance."

**[0:45-0:60] The Product**
- Visual: Clean cards showing verticals + stats
- "Domain-specific datasets. JSONL format. Drop into any SFT pipeline."
- "Every pair comes with proof-of-compute lineage."
- "Licensed, deduplicated, enterprise-ready."

**[0:60-0:75] Social Proof / Credibility**
- Visual: 30/30 benchmark badge, verification diagram
- "30 out of 30 on our SFT suitability benchmark."
- "Built on dedicated GPU infrastructure. Not shared cloud."
- "Zero patient data. Zero scraped PII."

- "We'll map your use case to our inventory."
- "swarmandbee.com/datasets"
- Logo. End.

**Production Notes**:
- Tone: Calm, technical, confident. Not salesy.
- Music: Minimal ambient. Think Stripe/Linear product videos.
- Typography: Large, clean, Inter or similar.
- Color: Cream backgrounds, dark text, gold accents on key stats.
- No stock footage. Text + animation + diagrams only.

Primary offering: Enterprise AI training datasets
Dataset strategy calls: https://swarmandbee.com/datasets

## What We Provide
Swarm & Bee produces large-scale, expert-verified training datasets designed for fine-tuning and evaluation of language models and AI systems.

Our datasets are designed for:
- LLM fine-tuning
- Domain-specific AI assistants
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Research agents
- Enterprise AI deployments

## Core Differentiators

### Verified Dataset Pairs
We create structured question-answer training pairs validated through multi-model and expert review pipelines. 790,000+ verified pairs. 30/30 SFT suitability benchmark. Every pair verified by a 235B-parameter model (Chain-of-Verification). 93.6% raw-to-platinum conversion rate.

### Proof of Lineage
Datasets include compute and generation provenance to ensure trust and reproducibility. Anchored on Hedera blockchain (HCS proofs + HTS NFTs).

### Domain Specialization
We focus on high-value professional verticals including:
- Medical AI (390K+ platinum pairs, 80 specialties, zero patient data)
- Aviation AI (MRO, pilot training, safety, ATC, drones — built from FAA handbooks and NASA ASRS reports)
- Legal AI (contract analysis, regulatory compliance, case research)
- Finance AI (underwriting, risk assessment, market analysis)
- Research and scientific domains (cross-domain reasoning, multi-hop Q&A)

### Production-Ready Format
Datasets are delivered in JSONL format ready for immediate integration into ML pipelines. Compatible with Unsloth, Axolotl, TRL, or custom SFT frameworks. Each pair includes: question, answer, specialty, tier, source, verification score.
